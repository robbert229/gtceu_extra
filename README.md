# GTCEu Extra Unofficial

## Description

This is the repository for GTCEu Extra Unofficial, a mod that provides a wide array of enhancements to GregTech 
including new machines, multiblocks, items, and production chains.

**It is unaffiliated with the GTCEu team, and project.**

It is in its early stages of development.

### Features

#### Battery Management Covers
These covers allow for battery buffers to import and export batteries into adjacent inventories. This allows for some 
creative setups for power distribution.

#### Steam Multiblocks
Steam Multi-blocks have been added for bulk processing in the steam age. They require a lot of bronze to create, and are
relatively limited in nature, however they allow for faster processing.

The steam multi-blocks do not accept a steam bus, and instead require ULV and above bus's. 

### Future Features

#### Algae

Introduces an Algae Reactor, and Algae Pool. Both provide ways of obtaining Algae, which can then be post processed into
various useful materials.

#### Fishing

Introduces a Fish Hatchery, and Fish Pond. Both provide ways of obtaining Fish.

#### Steam MultiBlocks

Introduces a number of multiblocks backported from GTNH.
